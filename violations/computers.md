# Gaming

> **CDER7. No Excessive Video Gaming**
> CodeDay is a creative event, and is not designed for students who simply want to play existing video games. Other than scheduled CodeDay activities, participants observed playing video games will be asked to stop, and may eventually be asked to leave.

Gaming is an effective way of dealing with stress, so students SHOULD be permitted to game for 30 minutes every 6 hours without staff involvement.

On observation of further gaming, staff SHOULD provide increasingly severe warnings that CodeDay is not an event for coding. If a student group exceeds 2 hours of gaming in a 6 hour period, staff SHOULD remove the participant from the event. Staff MAY also move the students into a room away from other participants.

Staff MUST NOT allow excessive gaming to proceed without some warnings.

# Torrents and Illegal Downloads

> **SCOC3**
> At StudentRND events, keep things safe and legal.

When illegal downloading is observed by staff, the participant MUST be warned to stop illegal downloads. Staff SHOULD regularly walk by the offender's computer throughout the rest of the event to look for signs of illegal downloads.

Repeat offenders MUST be removed from the event.

# Network Sniffing

> **SCOC3**
> At StudentRND events, keep things safe and legal.

Attendees expect that their private data remains private at CodeDay. Additionally, sniffing the regular CodeDay network is probably a violation of the Federal Wiretap Act. (If attendees argue such behavior is legal, you MAY also cite CDER11, "Staff Have Final Say.")

As a result, attendees observed using "Wifi Pineapples" and other sniffing technology MUST be warned to stop. Repeat offenders SHOULD be removed from the event.

Attendees using wifi sniffing for CodeDay projects SHOULD be allowed to do so on their own network.

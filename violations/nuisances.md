# Mess

> **CDER5. Do Not Make a Mess, and Clean Up After Yourself!**  
> Don't make an unnecessary mess, and clean up your space before you leave.

Students with a messy workspace should be encouraged to clean it up once the mess is noticed.

Students with repeated violations may be removed from the event.

# Disruptive Attendees

> **CDER8. Please Don't Be Disruptive**  
> Attendees who are regularly and actively disruptive to others may be asked to leave.

Attendees who are actively disruptive to others should be asked to calm down when the disruptive activity is first noticed. After three warnings, the attendee MAY be removed.

Students who are disruptive as the result of a disability, where the disruption is not dangerous to others, MUST NOT be asked to leave, but should be moved to an area of the venue where they will not disrupt other students, and a staff member should be assigned to check on them regularly.

# Teams Which Refuse To Participate

> **CDER9. Teams Must Pitch**  
> CodeDay is a community event. Teams formed before the event must pitch their idea during the pitches, and must be open to new members joining their team. Violating teams will be disqualified from all awards, and may be asked to leave. Please participate in the community!

Pre-formed teams attending the event which refuse to pitch or accept outside team members should be warned, and upon continuing to refuse, should be disqualified from all awards.

Teams MUST NOT be removed from the event for refusing to participate in the community, however.

# Alcohol and Drugs

> **SCOC3b**  
> Abstain from using or being under the influence of alcohol, marijuana, illicit substances, and recreational drugs.

Attendees observed by Staff using alcohol or controlled drugs at CodeDay MUST be removed and should be banned under the guidelines.

Where a report comes from Non-Staff, or where an attendee appears under the influence, you should talk to the attendee, but you MUST NOT take any enforcement action unless they admit fault, or by exception from the Policy team.

This policy MUST NOT be applied to students using controlled drugs with a prescription \(as evidenced by the storage of the drug in a prescription container\).

## Smoking and Vaping

Marijuana **does** fall under this policy, even where legal and where the student is of-age, except for medical marijuana.

Tobacco or non-marijuana vaping **does not **fall under this policy, however the student must be of legal age, and must smoke/vape outside or they may be removed under SCOC3, _keep things safe and legal._

\(nb: the legal age for smoking or vaping has been raised to 21 in California.\)

## Unidentified Drugs

If a student has pills in an unlabeled container \(such as a zip-lock baggie\), you should ask that the student refrain from taking the pills during the event \(except if the pill is obviously a vitamin or otherwise identifiable\), but MUST NOT take any enforcement action unless the student continues use.

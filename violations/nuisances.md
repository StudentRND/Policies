# Mess

> **CDER5. Do Not Make a Mess, and Clean Up After Yourself!**
> Don't make an unnecessary mess, and clean up your space before you leave.

Students with a messy workspace SHOULD be encouraged to clean it up once the mess is noticed.

Students with repeated violations MAY be removed from the event.

# Gaming

> **CDER7. No Excessive Video Gaming**
> CodeDay is a creative event, and is not designed for students who simply want to play existing video games. Other than scheduled CodeDay activities, participants observed playing video games will be asked to stop, and may eventually be asked to leave.

Gaming is an effective way of dealing with stress, so students SHOULD be permitted to game for 30 minutes every 6 hours without staff involvement.

On observation of further gaming, staff SHOULD provide increasingly severe warnings that CodeDay is not an event for coding. If a student group exceeds 2 hours of gaming in a 6 hour period, staff SHOULD remove the participant from the event. Staff MAY also move the students into a room away from other participants.

Staff MUST NOT allow excessive gaming to proceed without some warnings.

# Disruptive Attendees

> **CDER8. Please Don't Be Disruptive**
> Attendees who are regularly and actively disruptive to others may be asked to leave.

Attendees who are actively disruptive to others SHOULD be asked to calm down when the disruptive activity is first noticed. After three warnings, the attendee MAY be removed.

Students who are disruptive as the result of a disability, where the disruption is not dangerous to others, MUST NOT be asked to leave, but SHOULD be moved to an area of the venue where they will not disrupt other students, and a staff member SHOULD be assigned to check on them regularly.

# Teams Which Refuse To Participate

> **CDER9. Teams Must Pitch**
> CodeDay is a community event. Teams formed before the event must pitch their idea during the pitches, and must be open to new members joining their team. Violating teams will be disqualified from all awards, and may be asked to leave. Please participate in the community!

Pre-formed teams attending the event which refuse to pitch or accept outside team members SHOULD be warned, and upon continuing to refuse, SHOULD be disqualified from all awards.

Teams MUST NOT be removed from the event for refusing to participate in the community, however.

# Torrents and Illegal Downloads

> **SCOC3**
> At StudentRND events, keep things safe and legal.

When illegal downloading is observed by staff, the participant MUST be warned to stop illegal downloads. Staff SHOULD regularly walk by the offender's computer throughout the rest of the event to look for signs of illegal downloads.

Repeat offenders MUST be removed from the event.

# Network Sniffing

> **SCOC3**
> At StudentRND events, keep things safe and legal.

Attendees expect that their private data remains private at CodeDay. Additionally, sniffing the regular CodeDay network is probably a violation of the Federal Wiretap Act. (If attendees argue such behavior is legal, you MAY also cite CDER11, "Staff Have Final Say.")

As a result, attendees observed using "Wifi Pineapples" and other sniffing technology MUST be warned to stop. Repeat offenders SHOULD be removed from the event.

Attendees using wifi sniffing for CodeDay projects SHOULD be allowed to do so on their own network.

# Alcohol and Drugs

> **SCOC3b**
> Abstain from using or being under the influence of alcohol, marijuana, illicit substances, and recreational drugs.

Attendees observed by Staff using alcohol or drugs at CodeDay MUST be removed and SHOULD be banned under the guidelines.

You SHOULD talk to attendees reported by non-staff, or who seem under the influence, but MUST NOT take any enforcement action unless they admit fault, or by exception from the Policy team.

For the purposes of this policy, tobacco is not considered a drug, as long as the student is of legal age, and smokes outside.

Marijuana and alcohol _do_ fall under this policy, even where legal and where the student is of-age. The only exception is where the student has a license for medical use.

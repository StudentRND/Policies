This section describes policy for common rule violations.

# Unusual Violations

SCOC is deliberately vague, and CDER11 allows virtually any enforcement action:

> **CDER11. Staff Have Final Say**
> The organizers will interpret all event rules and the Code of Conduct in understanding of the spirit.
> 
> Organizers have the authority to disqualify you from any awards, remove you from the event, and have you banned from future events. If you're removed from the event, you will not receive a refund, and may need to call a parent to pick you up.
> 
> If you register for an event once you have been banned, you will not be allowed entry, and your ticket will not be refunded.

As a result, it's technically possible to consider any action a violation, which is important for legal coverage.

As a matter of policy, however, enforcement for any violations not specified in this section MUST be cleared by Policy Staff before enforcement.

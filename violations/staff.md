Staff MUST NOT be exempted from normal enforcement policy involving violations, whether as a suspect or a victim of a violation.

When a staff member is suspected of a violation, the Policy Team MUST be contacted.

The violation MUST be investigated by at least two other staff members \(if at least two other staff are present\) who should be the staff members who are least-friendly with the suspect.

The facts MUST be reviewed by the Policy Team, and the punishment MUST be determined by the Policy Team.

# Greater Scrutiny for Staff and Mentors

SCOC1a-c may be applied to the public behavior of staff and mentors, even when such behavior takes place outside of an event.

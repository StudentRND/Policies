# Knives

There are several reasons staff may observe use of a knife, all of which have different suggested enforcement actions:

## Utility Uses

If someone is using a knife for a utility purpose \(e.g. opening a package\) in a safe way, you should not take any enforcement action.

If someone is using a knife for a utility purpose in an unsafe way, you should warn the student against the unsafe use, and that knives are technically against the rules. If the student continues unsafe behavior, you MUST confiscate the knife if safe to do so. You MAY remove the student and MAY ban the student.

## "Showing Off"

Students from the suburbs who are in the city for the first time are often given knives to "protect themselves" by confused parents. Thinking it makes them look cool, these students often "show off" the knife to other students. This exact situation happens fairly frequently.

If someone is "showing off" the knife in a threatening way, follow the threatening use policy.

If someone is "showing off" the knife in a non-threatening way, you MUST confiscate the knife if safe to do so. If the violator is a high school student, you MAY remove the student, and MAY ban the student. If they are older, you MUST remove the student, and MUST ban the student.

## Dangerous or Threatening Use

If someone is using a knife in a threatening way, you should call the police, unless you feel confident you can confiscate the knife in a safe way. You MUST NOT put yourself in danger.

The student MUST be removed from the event, and MUST be banned.

# Other Weapons

If you can safely confiscate a weapon, you should, otherwise you MUST call the police.

# Guns

If you have a suspicion that someone is carrying a gun \(except where gun prohibitions are otherwise preempted by law\), you MUST call the police. You should ensure you and the attendees are as safe as possible until the police arrive.

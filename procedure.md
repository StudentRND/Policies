These steps should be conducted by Senior Staff. General Staff MUST NOT become involved in the resolution of an incident unless no Senior Staff is available, or the situation requires urgent action.

The role of General Staff should be only one of reporting and observing.

# Finding Out What Happened

Unless the situation requires an urgent response, before taking any action, Staff should try to gather as much information about the situation as possible.

People you should talk to include:

* The person who reported the violation, if any
* Any nearby staff
* Any nearby students
* The victims of the incident

Staff should not talk talk with the violators at this stage.

Information you should compile includes:

* The full names of everyone involved
  * Staff
  * Observers
  * Victims
  * Violators
* The specific behavior which occurred
* The circumstances surrounding the violation
* The time of the violation
* Any warnings which were given
* Any injuries which were sustained \(which should be treated under Medical policies\)

## Dealing With Victims

Any victims of a violation MUST be made to feel comfortable. They should be offered:

* A private place to talk
* A friend or other trusted person
* Policy Team contact information

At their request, law enforcement should be called, however this should only be specifically offered at the discretion of staff.

You MUST NOT suggest they withdraw the complaint in any way, and MUST NOT suggest that the complaint is not serious. You MUST NOT ask for advice on penalties for the violation.

## Dealing with Suspects

You should assign Staff to watch over suspected violators while you are gathering details about what happened. If possible, this should include Senior Staff.

# Deciding on Enforcement Actions

You should look at whether the preponderance of evidence suggests a violation occurred when deciding what enforcement path to take.

## If The Report Can Be Substantiated

You MUST use whatever enforcement tools are necessary to resolve the situation. Enforcement actions are listed later in this guide.

Where a specific policy exists in the Violations section, the policy MUST be followed.

## If The Report Cannot Be Substantiated

You should not perform any enforcement action, but MUST give the accused violator a warning that staff will continue to keep watch, and that such behavior, if later substantiated, would be unacceptable.

If a later report of a violation is substantiated involving a participant who was previously warned, the participant MUST be removed, and MUST be banned for at least one year.

# Communicating With Involved Parties

The enforcement actions should be first communicated with the suspect/violator before anyone else involved in the incident. You should make it clear that there is no appeal of direct enforcement actions possible, and that an appeal is only possible for future bans.

You should also let the victim know what enforcement action is being taken and why.

You should not communicate about the circumstances or behaviors of the violation to other students. You may communicate about what enforcement action was taken, but not why. Talking about specifics of a behavior opens us to concerns of libel.

# Filing a Report

All incidents MUST be reported before the end of the event, and should be reported as soon as possible after their conclusion.

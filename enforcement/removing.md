As a result of a violation, all attendees may be asked to leave the event.

When asking an attendee to leave, staff should immediately have the attendee pack up their things, and should move the packed-up things to a secure area until the attendee is ready to go.

Once the attendee's things are packed, the attendee should not be allowed to return to the primary area where CodeDay is happening.

# Students Who Are Over 18

Students who are over 18 may be asked to leave immedately, and you should call security or law enforcement if a student refuses to leave once asked.

Unless the violation was severe, however, you should allow an attendee to call a ride and wait for their ride to arrive before leaving, however the attendee should be kept separate from the rest of the event and supervised.

# Students Who Are Under 18

Students who are under 18 MUST NOT be forced to leave until a parent or guardian is present. When this enforcement action is taken, you should call the emergency contacts listed on Clear and ask that they pick the student up.

While waiting, the attendee should be kept separate from the rest of the event and supervised.

The attendee should not be prevented from leaving if they insist, as this may be considered unlawful detention.

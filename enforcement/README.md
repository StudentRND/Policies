# Enforcement Permission Levels

## Non-Staff

Non-staff have no enforcement powers with regards to any StudentRND Policies. For the purposes of these rules, Mentors, Judges, Sponsors, Press, and VIPs are all considered non-staff.

## Level 1 Staff

Teachers, Volunteers, and other Event Staff SHOULD look for policy violations, but MUST NOT enforce policy except in urgent situations.

## Level 2 Staff

Regional Managers, Event Managers, and Code Evangelists MUST look for policy violations, and have full enforcement permissions for documented policies except where otherwise limited.

Code Evangelists SHOULD, if possible, be assigned to talk with students about violations, as they're trained for it. If a Code Evangelist is not available, other Level 2 Staff MAY talk with students about violations.

For the purposes of these policies, anyone with a current Code Evangelist certification is included as a Code Evangelist, whether or not they are assigned to the specific event.

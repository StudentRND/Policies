Bans are entered by the Policy Team in response to an incident report \(see "Incident Response"\), which uses the following guidelines.

# College or Older

Most bans for college students are forever, as we do not expect the students to further mature in the future.

# Younger Students

* Harassment -- one-year ban, e.g.
  * Making disparaging remarks about another students project or coding abilities \(if a warning was provided first\).
  * "Picking on" another student.
  * Obvious, more extreme harassment.
* Drugs and Alcohol -- one-year ban.
  * Does **not** include smoking \(outside\) if the student is of-age.
  * **Does** include use of marajuana or alcohol, even if legal in the jurisdiction and the student is of-age, except with a medical prescription.
  * **Does **include being obviously under the influence of drugs or alcohol. "Obvious" in this case should usually mean smell and some other indication.
  * Medical uses of marajuana are allowed, but they should contact us.
* Weapons
  * "Utility" use of a knife \(e.g. opening a box\) -- use your discretion. Unless something else worries you \(or the event is hosted at a school\), you can probably ignore this entirely. According to the rules, even staff use of knives would be prohibited, but that would be unreasonable. We are not the TSA.
  * Student "showing off" a knife -- suggested event removal, option for one-season ban. This comes up a lot when overprotective suburban parents give their student a knive for "safety" because they'll be in the city, and an immature student thinks it makes them hardcore. This is poor judgement which can cause them many problems later, but not threatening on its own.
  * Threatening use of a knife, or posession of any other weapon -- lifetime ban.
* Other Code of Conduct
  * "Hitting on" another student, even if they seem receptive -- suggested one-year ban.
  * Theft -- suggested two-year ban for high school students, lifetime for college students.
* Age-related
  * Too Young -- 1-2 years, until they should be old enough to reasonably attend
  * Too Old -- Forever
* Recruiter -- Forever

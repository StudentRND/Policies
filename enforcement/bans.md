In some cases you may need to ban attendees from attending future events. 

Only Event Managers, Regional Managers, Code Evangelists are authorized to enter bans, and only for their own events. Other staff MUST NOT enter bans.

StudentRND Policy Staff will review all bans periodically and may override them, however you should strive to get things right from the start.

# How to Enter Bans

Bans are processed through Clear, and will prevent attendees from registering for future events with the same email for the period of the ban.

When entering a ban, you'll need to choose a ban reason \(which will be displayed to the student if they try to register\) and provide additional details, which will only be visible to event staff.

It's important you provide as many details as possible in case the student requests review later.

# Ban Reasons

You MUST only issue bans for SCOC and CDER violations.

You MUST NOT ban students for non-Conduct or Rules violations without prior clearance from StudentRND Policy Staff.

# Common Bans and Suggested Durations

Ban duration is at your discretion, however we RECOMMEND following these guidelines unless the violation is unusual to help ensure bans are applied consistently and reduce the chance that bans need to be modified on review.

**The following suggestions are for middle school and high school students only. Bans of college-age students SHOULD be permanent,** because college students should generally know better, and are less likely to mature and "grow out of it."

* Harassment -- Suggested one-year ban, e.g.
  * Making disparaging remarks about another students project or coding abilities \(if a warning was provided first\).
  * "Picking on" another student.
  * Obvious, more extreme harassment.
* Drugs and Alcohol -- Suggested one-year ban.
  * Does **not** include smoking \(outside\) if the student is of-age.
  * **Does** include use of marajuana or alcohol, even if legal in the jurisdiction and the student is of-age, except with a medical prescription.
  * **Does **include being obviously under the influence of drugs or alcohol. "Obvious" in this case should usually mean smell and some other indication.
  * Medical uses of marajuana are allowed, but they should contact us.
* Weapons
  * "Utility" use of a knife \(e.g. opening a box\) -- use your discretion. Unless something else worries you \(or the event is hosted at a school\), you can probably ignore this entirely. According to the rules, even staff use of knives would be prohibited, but that would be unreasonable. We are not the TSA.
  * Student "showing off" a knife -- suggested event removal, option for one-season ban. This comes up a lot when overprotective suburban parents give their student a knive for "safety" because they'll be in the city, and an immature student thinks it makes them hardcore. This is poor judgement which can cause them many problems later, but not threatening on its own.
  * Threatening use of a knife, or posession of any other weapon -- lifetime ban.
* Other Code of Conduct
  * "Hitting on" another student, even if they seem receptive -- suggested one-year ban.
  * Theft -- suggested two-year ban for high school students, lifetime for college students.
* Age-related
  * Too Young -- 1-2 years, until they should be old enough to reasonably attend
  * Too Old -- Forever
* Recruiter -- Forever

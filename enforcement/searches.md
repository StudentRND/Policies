> To register for CodeDay, you must consent to StudentRND's search of your belongings if we have a reasonable suspicion that you are concealing a weapon, illegal or banned drugs or alcohol, or a stolen item.

# When to Conduct a Search

You MUST only conduct a search when you have a reasonable suspicion that (a) an attendee has a stolen item, and (b) a search of the attendee's belongings will turn up the stolen item. You MUST have pre-approval from StudentRND's Policy Team for a search.

"Reasonable suspicion" follows the US Government's definition, which means having "specific and articulable facts ... taken together with rational inferences from those facts." It must be more than a suspicion or a hunch.

You MUST NOT conduct a "blanket" search of all attendees, or of a group of attendees.

## Searches Only for Stolen Property

Despite our ability to do so, you MUST NOT conduct searches for drugs or alcohol, you SHOULD wait to see the drugs or alcohol in the open.

**You MUST NOT conduct a search if you think a student is concealing a weapon. If you believe the student is a danger, you MUST call 911 and let the police deal with it.**

# Approval for Searches

Pre-approval for searches MUST be obtained from StudentRND Policy Staff prior to conducting the search. You SHOULD request this approval before talking to the student.

The Policy Staff will request an explanation of your case for reasonable suspicion and make a decision.

# Procedure for Searches

Searches MUST be conducted by a Code Evangelist. Other event staff MUST NOT conduct searches.

Code Evangelists SHOULD follow normal procedures for resolving conflicts in accordance with their training.

You MUST NOT detain an attendee. You SHOULD NOT allow attendees to simply chose to "opt-out" of a search, but you MUST NOT not attempt to restrain an attendee who tries to leave the venue.

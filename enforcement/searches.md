The purpose of this policy is to recover stolen property in cases where there is an abundance of evidence suggesting who stole it.

Searches MUST only be conducted for stolen property of significant value.

Despite our ability to do so, you MUST NOT conduct searches for drugs or alcohol, you should wait to see the drugs or alcohol in the open. You MUST NOT conduct a search if you think a student is concealing a weapon. If you believe the student is a danger, you MUST call 911 and let the police deal with it.

# When to Conduct a Search

You MUST only conduct a search when you have a reasonable suspicion that \(a\) an attendee has a stolen item, and \(b\) a search of the attendee's belongings will turn up the stolen item. You MUST have pre-approval from the Policy Team.

"Reasonable suspicion" MUST include either:

* A report from a staff member who saw the student steal and hide the item, OR

* A report from two or more attendees who saw the student steal and hide the item, at least one of whom has no close personal tie to the person whose property was stolen, OR

* Surveillance footage.

\(This MUST also meet the US government of reasonable suspicion: "specific and articulable facts ... taken together with rational inferences from those facts"\)

You MUST NOT conduct a "blanket" search of all attendees, or of a group of attendees.

# Approval for Searches

Pre-approval for searches MUST be obtained from Policy Staff prior to conducting the search. You should request this approval before talking to the student.

The Policy Staff will request an explanation of your case for reasonable suspicion and make a decision.

# Procedure for Searches

Searches MUST be conducted by a Code Evangelist. Code Evangelists should follow normal procedures for resolving conflicts in accordance with their training.

You MUST NOT detain an attendee. You should not allow attendees to simply chose to "opt-out" of a search, but you MUST NOT not attempt to restrain an attendee who tries to leave the venue. In such a case, you should suggest filing a police report.

You MUST NOT touch an attendee or their belongings. You should ask the attendee to show you the contents of their belongings in a level of detail sufficient to reveal the stolen item, taking its size into account. You MUST NOT search in any more detail than is necessary.

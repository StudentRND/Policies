# Gaming

> **CDER7. No Excessive Video Gaming**
> CodeDay is a creative event, and is not designed for students who simply want to play existing video games. Other than scheduled CodeDay activities, participants observed playing video games will be asked to stop, and may eventually be asked to leave.

Gaming is an effective way of dealing with stress, so students SHOULD be permitted to game for 30 minutes every 6 hours without staff involvement.

On observation of further gaming, staff SHOULD provide increasingly severe warnings that CodeDay is not an event for coding. If a student group exceeds 2 hours of gaming in a 6 hour period, staff SHOULD remove the participant from the event. Staff MAY also move the students into a room away from other participants.

Staff MUST NOT allow excessive gaming to proceed without some warnings.

# Torrents and Illegal Downloads

When illegal downloading is observed by staff, the participant MUST be warned to stop illegal downloads. Staff SHOULD regularly walk by the offender's computer throughout the rest of the event to look for signs of illegal downloads.

Repeated offenders MUST be removed from the event.

# Mess

> **CDER5. Do Not Make a Mess, and Clean Up After Yourself!**
> Don't make an unnecessary mess, and clean up your space before you leave.

Students with a messy workspace SHOULD be encouraged to clean it up once the mess is noticed.

Students with repeated violations MAY be removed from the event.

# Alcohol and Drugs

> **SCOC3b. Abstain from using or being under the influence of alcohol, marijuana, illicit substances, and recreational drugs.**

As part of the CodeDay event rules (CDER6), participants agree to searches under some conditions:

> **CDER6. Searches**
> To register for CodeDay, you must consent to StudentRND's search of your belongings if we have a reasonable suspicion that you are concealing a weapon, illegal or banned drugs or alcohol, or a stolen item.

# When to Conduct a Search

You MUST only conduct a search when you have a reasonable suspicion that an attendee has a stolen item.

Despite our ability to do so, you MUST NOT conduct searches for drugs or alcohol, you SHOULD wait to see the drugs or alcohol in the open.

**You MUST NOT conduct a search if you think a student is concealing a weapon. If you believe the student is a danger, you MUST call 911 and let the police deal with it.**

# Procedure for Searches

Only Code Evangelists are authorized to conduct searches.

Code Evangelists should follow normal procedures for resolving conflicts in accordance with their training. Attendees may not "choose to leave," however you should also not attempt to restrain an attendee who tries to leave anyway.

The following table describes the most common violations, and the required responses.

"1st Action" is the action you should take first, and usually lists the allowed number of warnings. "Final Action" lists the action you should take after warnings are exhausted, or if you don't believe warning is justified.

As soon as possible, you MUST file an incident report for any detailed investigation, or final action. Please report incidents here: [https://srnd.wufoo.com/forms/incident-report/](https://srnd.wufoo.com/forms/incident-report/)

**You do not have to get involved if you feel unsafe. Call 911 instead.**

## Violations By Non-Students

When a violation is reported which involves event staff, voluteers, mentors, judges, or sponsors, the Policy Team MUST be contacted immediately.

The violation MUST be investigated by at least two other staff members (if at least two other staff are present) who should be the staff members who are least-friendly with the suspect.

The facts MUST be reviewed and the punishment determined by the Policy Team.

## Greater Scrutiny

Violations involving anyone in college or above should be awarded less leniency, as the participants are unlikely to learn from their behavior -- they already know it's wrong.
